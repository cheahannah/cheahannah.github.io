Tools: Python (numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib), Jupyter Notebooks

* Split email data into training and test set, then cleaned data by replacing NaN values and removing line breaks, multiple spaces, and stopwords
* Used a logistic regression classifier to test the accuracy of the model to check if model was classifying the emails as spam or ham
* Improved accuracy through amount of punctuation in the email, amount of characters in the email subject and body, and amount of unique words used in each email
* Participated in class-wide Kaggle competition and achieved a test accuracy of 0.90857
