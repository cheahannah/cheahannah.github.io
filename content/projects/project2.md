* Split the email data up into a training set and a test set
* Used a logistic regression classifier to test the accuracy of the model to see if it was classifying the emails into correct categories.
* Improved accuracy through amount of punctuation in the email, amount of upper case letters, amount of characters in each email, and amount of unique words used in each email.
