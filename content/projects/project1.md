*  Executed data science life cycle on 98,000-point dataset: data selection and cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and model selection
* Generated and fit linear regression model to predict travel time of a taxi ride in Manhattan
* Implemented a tree regression model to increase accuracy of prediction decreased root mean square error by 43%
